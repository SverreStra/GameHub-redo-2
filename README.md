# Game Hub Course Assingment

This was my first Course Assignment, this has also been updated from the first version.

  - This project, I was tasked with making an store website that sold video games, the user could click on one games, there would be possible to see facts about one game.
  Since this was an assignment and we only had to make one gameinfo page, the game you will see when you click on any of the is the Assassin game.
  
  - My goal for this site now is to try and make the contact page more useable. Make the form work.
  - Make the page more prettier
  - Clean up the code a little bit
  - Use more JavaScript
  - Add more content
  
 Built With:
 HTML, CSS and Javascript
 
 I only used Javascript for the navbar.
 
 How to get the Repo is by clone it:
 
 Since this was a school project I was the only worker on the project.

 Update 25.02.24

 I have changed the products, from being hardcoded into the website using HTML, the products now are fetched from an API that I have made on Wordpress.
